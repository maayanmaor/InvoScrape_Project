## About The Project

InvoScrape is a system that deals with extracting data from structured and unstructured invoices using optical character recognition technology. 
The system contributes to turning manual processes into automatic ones. Developing automation for these processes will save the organization a lot of time and manpower in extracting information from invoices and focusing on other critical issues. The system allows extracting information from a variety of file types in different formats, including printed and handwritten invoices, and makes the information accessible in a convenient way for reading and use.
